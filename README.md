He/Him/Wah <br> Cute fluffy red panda 🍎

I like red pandas, arts 🎨, photography 📸, plushies 🧸, technology 👨‍💻 and other stuff

Mainly writing code on python, but sometimes I try new things. 👨‍💻 <br> Currently learning more about front-end development. 🤓

I photograph random stuff, mostly landscapes 📸 <br> My main camera is «Lumix FZ-8», but sometimes I take photos on my phone. <br> all of my photos are available at a [website](https://wah.su/photos)
